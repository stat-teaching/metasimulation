## Materials üìò

- üåê All the **material** (code, slides, extra) are available **Github** [github.com/stat-teaching/csameta2024](https://github.com/stat-teaching/csameta2024) 
- üìù Slides are created with **Quarto**, you can use it as standard slides (in *html* format) and see the source code (`.qmd` file)
- There will be references at the end of each slide deck. You will se a button where you can download the `.bib` file to import into your reference manager.

## Disclaimer

- We are using a lot of (R) code. When talking about code there is no a unique solution or method. My approach is not the best. If your code works, everything good :smile:
- If we have time, we can discuss about best practice in writing code in terms of efficiency, organization and clarity :sunglasses:
- Also for statistics related topics, there are often multiple options to solve a problem. If you know other alternatives beyond the proposed topics, we can discuss it :wink:
